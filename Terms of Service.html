            <li>Locking Period: Commissions are held in a "Pending" state for a period determined by us (currently set to 35 days, but subject to change at our sole discretion) after the order is shipped. This period accounts for our return policy and processing time.</li>
            <li>Fraud Prevention: We strictly prohibit self-referrals, cookie stuffing, bot traffic, bidding on branded keywords, or any fraudulent activity to generate commissions. We reserve the right to withhold commissions and suspend accounts if fraud is detected.</li>
